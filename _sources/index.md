# CodingNotes

*Notes I wish I had when I started in computational chemistry with no programming experience*

```

I hope you find some of the information helpful.

1. **Programming**

   - Command line, `Bash``, `vi/vim`, and other terminal stuff
   - Supercomputing stuff (`ssh`/Slurm)
   - General `python` coding and managing with `conda` environments 
  
  <br>

2. **Visualization Software**

    Softwares I use the most often are:

    - [IQmol](http://iqmol.org)
    - [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) 
    - [VMD]( https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)
    - [ChemDraw](https://connect.revvitysignals.com/sitesubscription/Gallery.aspx)
    - [Schrodinger Maestro](https://www.schrodinger.com/products/maestro)

<br>

3. **Simulations with [AmberMD](http://ambermd.org)**

    I have read the Amber manual so much, it would be a waste not to summarize them here
    
    Also some modern tutorials for simulations methods in:

    * Classical Molecular Dynamics Simulations
    * Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics Simulations

<br>

4. **Cloud-Based Web Services**

    Neat websites I learned about during my Ph.D!

   * [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) 
   * [GitHub](https://github.com) 

<br>

5. Other fun activities while researching...
    
    Like making this website with Jekyll and JupyterBook
