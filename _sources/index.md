This collection was an attempt to consolidated my experiences in computational chemistry. Entering the field with no background in mathematics or computers, a lot was learned through trial and error. Despite these shortcomings, I am forever grateful to the exceptional guidance and continued support of Dr. Genwei Zhang, Dr. Zheng Pei, Dr. Xiaoliang Pan, and Dr. Yihan Shao.

I hope many of you will find this information useful in your future endeavors.
