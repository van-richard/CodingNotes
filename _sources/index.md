# CodingNotes

Notes I wish I had when I started in computational chemistry with no programming experience.

Hopefully, my website contains some guidance for:

## Programming

- Command line, `Bash`, text editing with `vi/vim`, and other terminal stuff
- Supercomputering stuff (`ssh`/Slurm)
- General `python` coding and managing with `conda` environments

## Visualization Softwares

Common softwares for visualizing small-molecules/proteins are (links to official website included):

- [IQmol](http://iqmol.org)
- [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) 
- [VMD]( https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)
- [ChemDraw](https://connect.revvitysignals.com/sitesubscription/Gallery.aspx)
- [Schrodinger Maestro](https://www.schrodinger.com/products/maestro)

## Molecular Simulations

- Introduction to Simulations with [AmberMD](http://ambermd.org)
- Tutorials for various MD methods:
    - Classical Molecular Dynamics Simulations
    - Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics Simulations

## Cloud-Based Web Services

- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) for writing
- [GitHub](https://github.com) for code management

## Other Fun Programming Activities

- Creating Your Own Website (JupyterBook, Github)
