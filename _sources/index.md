# Preface

These notes are dedicated to my one and only brain cell. Kudos.

To answer your questions:

- Yes, I also joined a computational lab with no prior experiences in coding
- Yes, the learning process was super miserable at the beginning
- Yes, nothing makes sense
- Yes, you might pick up (arguably) bad habits because you spend a month debugging code
- No, it doesn't get better. You just get stronger :-)

## Objective

- To go beyong copy/paste commands !!!
- Accessing the supercomputer and being a good person (when submitting jobs)
- Coding with Python !! if only I could download the correct python version...
- Contribute to the chaos of molecular structure and file formats 
- Cry
