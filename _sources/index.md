# Preface

_dedicated to my one and only brain cell. Kudos._

- got some questions? 
    - yeah, I also joined a computational lab with no prior experiences in coding
    - yeah, the learning process was super miserable at the beginning
    - yeah, nothing makes sense
    - yeah, you might pick up (arguably) bad habits because you spend a month debugging code
    - yeah, I ~~cried too~~ cry all the time
    - no, it doesn't get better. You just get stronger :-)

### the objective here .... and stuff

:::{admonition} If you're new here
:class: sidebar note

- skim through the [quickstart](https://van-richard.github.io/CodingNotes/notebooks/00-quickstart/00_overview.html) section for a general overview of:
    - quick & dirty introduction to our _"lab equipment/research tools"_
    - general information on supercomputer access (and how to be nice / not waste resources)
    - __guide to help setup computer for research__
        - command-line : typing commands vs. clicking with mouse
        - coding with `Python` : downloading/managing, general use
    - introduction to chemical structure file formats:  PDBs, XYZs, and others
- Ask questions when you're confused !!!
    - anyone in the lab will be able to answer or guide you to the answer
    - Google will not be helpful
- stay hydrated !!! might cry
- Repeat Step 1. but read it this time, because you were too shy to ask questions
:::

**For Richard:**
1. find stuff I did and totally forgotten
2. command-line things I picked up over the years
3. compiling programs/software notes
4. Simulation: Theory, Methods, Approaches


**For you (probably):**
1. a place to start (_Google sucks when you don't know what to Google_)
2. resources/guide to the world of computational chemistry
3. notes from our programming session (I probably didn't explain something)
4. explains (maybe) the coding workflow I developed over the Ph.D.
