# Jargon

:::{Glossary}
linux
    Like Windows and MacOS, Linux is just another operating system, but unlike the others, it is open-source.

        Example: Many servers use Linux systems. Both supersupers we use are linux based (Oscer & Pete).

unix
    Like Linux, composed of kernals, shell, etc. **but** this is not open-source, you need a license for use.
    
        Example: MacOS

Graphic User Interface
