# Jargon

Some terminology

```{Glossary}
Linux
    Like Windows and MacOS, Linux is just another operating system, but unlike the others, it is open-source.

    Example: Many servers use Linux systems. Both supersupers we use are linux based (Oscer & Pete).

Unix
    Like Linux, composed of kernals, shell, etc. **but** this is not open-source, you need a license for use.
    
    Example: MacOS

Terminal
    A small window to which you see all your mistakes and feel all the dread and dispair. 

    **Just kidding!** It's just an application that opens window on your screen, and you can only type commmand which mokes other computer things function. The windows equivalent is the command prompt

Command Line
    or command line interace (CLI). I guess the differnce with the Terminal, this the action of typing commands.
