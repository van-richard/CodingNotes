Python is a programming language we all use day-to-day in data analysis, machine learning, and figure/movie-making!

When I say Conda, I'm refering to a python management software which includes [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/), [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), or [Mambaforge](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Some open-source programs are written in python and then hosted on GitHub, which is great!.... Until you find it's written in a different verions of python...

I had multiple verison of python on laptop until I was shown **Conda**!

The perks of using Conda to manage python is the ability to create *virtual environments* in your computer.

With `conda` commands, you can create an evironment (i.e. a small storage space in your laptop) to install some pecific versions of packages. **And this will not interferece or conflict with anything else on your computer!**

I mainly use {term}`Miniforge` on laptop and supercomputer accounts, but be sure to explore what works best for you!
