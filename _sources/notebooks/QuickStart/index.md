Quick Start Guide
=================

**Day 1** doing computational chemistry. Have luck!

  - Written for those completely unfamiliar with computers
  - Too much jargon, so don't rush it

**Objective** To provide *just* enough information to get you feeling comfortable with:

  1. Terminal and Command Line
  2. Supercomputing and SLURM
  3. Python and Conda
  4. Sturcture Files (`.pdb`/`.xyz`)
  5. Molecular Dynamics with Amber

**Confused?** None of this will make sense, I know. It will take some time until you feel comfortable, so don't worry too much! 

  - Practice every day! 

  - See something cool? Try it!

  - Better way to program something? Probably. **BUT WHERE'S THE FUN WITHOUT A FEW F's**

**Info, Example, and Task** This section is quite bare. Once you feel comfortable, try the other sections! If you're confused, don't hesitate to send me questions!
