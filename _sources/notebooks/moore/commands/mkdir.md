# `mkdir` - make new directories.

```bash
mkdir myNewDir
```

The `-p` flag causes new intermediate directories to be created as necessary.

```bash
mkdir -p myNewDir/with/intermediate/directories
```

If the intermediate directories didn't already exist, running the above command without the `-p` flag would return an error
