    "> \"Secure Shell Protocol is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution. SSH applications are based on a client–server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server.\"\n",

This is a hidden file, stored by default in a hidden directory, called `/.ssh/known_hosts`, in the your home directory. Once the host key has been stored in the known_hosts file, the client system can connect directly to that server again without need for any approvals."
