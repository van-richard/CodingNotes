# `cd` - change directories

Since bash works in the context of a current directory, you might want to run your command in some other directory. We have cd for changing location:

Change to home directory

```bash
cd ~ 
```

or

```bash
cd     
```

Go back one directory

```bash
cd ../
```

Go to specific directory

```bash
cd /home/username/Documents  
```

Go the the previous directory you were in

```bash
cd -   
```
