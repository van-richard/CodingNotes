    "variable=\"Some string\"\n",

    "variable = \"Some string\" # => returns error \"variable: command not found\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash will decide that `variable` is a command it must execute and give an error because it can't be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "variable= \"Some string\" # => returns error: \"Some string: command not found\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash will decide that \"Some string\" is a command it must execute and give an error because it can't be found. In this case the \"variable=\" part is seen as a variable assignment valid only for the scope of the \"Some string\" command. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"$variable\" # => Some string\n",
    "echo '$variable' # => $variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use a variable itself — assign it, export it, or else — you write its name without `$`. If you want to use the variable's value, you should use `$`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `'` (single quote) won't expand the variables! You can write variable without surrounding quotes but it's not recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter expansion `${...}`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"${variable}\" # => Some string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple usage of parameter expansion such as two examples above. Parameter expansion gets a value from a variable. It \"expands\" or prints the value. During the expansion time the value or parameter can be modified. Below are other modifications that add onto this expansion.\n",

    "String substitution in variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "This will return only the first 7 characters of the value\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"${variable: -5}\" # => string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return the last 5 characters (note the space before -5). The space before minus is mandatory here. String length:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"${#variable}\" # => 11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Indirect expansion:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "other_variable=\"variable\"\n",
    "echo ${!other_variable} # => Some string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will expand the value of `other_variable`.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"${foo:-\"DefaultValueIfFooIsMissingOrEmpty\"}\"\n",
    "# => DefaultValueIfFooIsMissingOrEmpty\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This works for null (`foo=`) and empty string (`foo=\"\"`); zero (`foo=0`) returns `0`. Note that it only returns default value and doesn't change variable value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Declare an array with 6 elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "array=(one two three four five six)\n",

    "echo \"Script's PID: $$\"\n",
    "echo \"Number of arguments passed to script: $#\"\n",

    "echo {a..z} # => a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n",
    "```\n",

    "Now that we know how to echo and use variables, let's learn some of the other basics of Bash!\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current directory is available through the command `pwd`. `pwd` stands for \"print working directory\". We can also use the built-in variable `$PWD`. Observe that the following are equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"I'm in $(pwd)\" # execs `pwd` and interpolates output\n",
    "echo \"I'm in $PWD\" # interpolates the variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get too much output in your terminal, or from a script, the command `clear` clears your screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "clear\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`Ctrl-L` also works for clearing output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading a value from input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"What's your name?\"\n",
    "read name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we didn't need to declare a new variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"Hello, $name!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also conditional execution\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"Always executed\" || echo \"Only executed if first command fails\"\n",
    "# => Always executed\n",
    "echo \"Always executed\" && echo \"Only executed if first command does NOT fail\"\n",
    "# => Always executed\n",
    "# => Only executed if first command does NOT fail\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A single ampersand `&` after a command runs it in the background. A background command's output is printed to the terminal, but it cannot read from the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sleep 30 &\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "List background jobs\n",

    "Results (stdout) of the previous command can be passed as input (stdin) to the next command using a pipe `|`. Commands chained in this way are called a \"pipeline\", and are run concurrently.

    "Look into `scp` or `sftp` if you plan on exchanging files between computers. `scp` behaves very similarly to `cp`. `sftp` is more interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can redirect command input and output (stdin, stdout, and stderr) using \"redirection operators\". Unlike a pipe, which passes output to a command, a redirection operator has a command's input come from a file or stream, or sends its output to a file or stream.\n",
