    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "First line of the script is the shebang which tells the system how to execute the script: \n",
    "\n",
    "[Shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments start with `#`. The `shebang` is also a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command\n",
    "\n",
    "Each command starts on a new line, or after a semicolon:\n",

    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Declaring a variable looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "variable=\"Some string\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**But not like this:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "variable = \"Some string\" # => returns error \"variable: command not found\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash will decide that `variable` is a command it must execute and give an error because it can't be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "variable= \"Some string\" # => returns error: \"Some string: command not found\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash will decide that \"Some string\" is a command it must execute and give an error because it can't be found. In this case the \"variable=\" part is seen as a variable assignment valid only for the scope of the \"Some string\" command. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"$variable\" # => Some string\n",
    "echo '$variable' # => $variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use a variable itself — assign it, export it, or else — you write its name without `$`. If you want to use the variable's value, you should use `$`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `'` (single quote) won't expand the variables! You can write variable without surrounding quotes but it's not recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter expansion `${...}`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"${variable}\" # => Some string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple usage of parameter expansion such as two examples above. Parameter expansion gets a value from a variable. It \"expands\" or prints the value. During the expansion time the value or parameter can be modified. Below are other modifications that add onto this expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "String substitution in variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"${variable/Some/A}\" # => A string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will substitute the first occurrence of \"Some\" with \"A\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Substring from a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "length=7\n",
    "echo \"${variable:0:length}\" # => Some string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return only the first 7 characters of the value\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"${variable: -5}\" # => string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return the last 5 characters (note the space before -5). The space before minus is mandatory here. String length:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"${#variable}\" # => 11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Indirect expansion:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "other_variable=\"variable\"\n",
    "echo ${!other_variable} # => Some string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will expand the value of `other_variable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default value for variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"${foo:-\"DefaultValueIfFooIsMissingOrEmpty\"}\"\n",
    "# => DefaultValueIfFooIsMissingOrEmpty\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This works for null (`foo=`) and empty string (`foo=\"\"`); zero (`foo=0`) returns `0`. Note that it only returns default value and doesn't change variable value."
