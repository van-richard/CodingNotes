    "Before you run any simulation, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is your scientific question?\n",
    "- Can your hypothesis be tested with MD?\n",
    "- Is there experimental evidence for the property you're investigating?\n",

    "General steps of running molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are shown below. However, consider the following questions before running you systems should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. System Preparations\n",
    "     - What ions or molecules are in your system?\n",
    "     - Is the force field for each type of ion/molecule sufficient?\n",
    "     - What protonation states are your titratable residues?\n",
    "2. Equilibrate the System\n",
    "    - What is the target environmental conditions for your system?\n",
    "    - Is temperature, pressure, and/or the energy of the sytem stable? \n",

    "    - How long do you need your simulation?\n",
    "4. Analysis of Trajectories\n",
    "    - What property of the system addresses your hypothesis?"
