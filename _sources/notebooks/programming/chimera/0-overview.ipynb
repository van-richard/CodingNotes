    "Chimera and [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) are both great molecular visualization tools developed by UCSF.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChimeraX is the newest program, and it can efficiently handle large data (i.e. PDBs with thousands of atoms). It is my prefered GUI when exploring new structures and making videos/figures.\n",

    "open *PDB_CODE*\n",

    "### Command line is independent of model panel!\n",

    "| hide [model #] [ribbon, atom, etc.] | Hides the selection in ribbon, atom, etc. | \n",
    "| color byhetero | Colors by hetero-atom |\n",
    "| color bychain | Colors by chain |\n",
    "| color bymodel | Colors by model # |\n",
    "| split [option: model #] | Splits the model by chain |\n",
    "| sel [model, chain, residue, or atom #] | Select the model, chain, residue, or atom |"
