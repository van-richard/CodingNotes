# Saving Images

You can save figures using the command line interface. The following example saves the display as a `.png` file. `Supersample 3` helps the quality, and `transparentBackground` removes the white background.

One liner:

```
save ~/Desktop/picture.png supersample 3 transparentBackground True
```


```python

```
