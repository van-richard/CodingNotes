    "The structures of proteins and small-molecules can be solved via experimental methods, NMR, some examples include NMR, X-ray crystallography, and Cryo-EM.

    "Protein structures are saved and shared via the [Protein Data Bank at the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB)](https://www.rcsb.org) as `.pdb` files. These files follow a text file standard discussed later\n",

    "\n",
    "A simple and widely used file format in computational chemistry and molecular modeling. Often used to represent the three-dimensional coordinates of atoms or small molecules. The `.xyz` files are plain text files that contain atomic coordinates, atom types, and sometimes additional information about the system. These files are often used in Quantum Mechanics (QM) calculations!"

    "## What is a Chain Identifier (Column 5 of `ATOM`)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A chain identifier is a single-character label used to distinguish and identify different polypeptide chains or structural components within a macromolecular structure. Each chain in a PDB file is assigned a unique chain identifier, allowing for the unambiguous identification of individual protein or nucleic acid chains within the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is commonly represented as a single uppercase letter, such as 'A,' 'B,' 'C,' and so on. It's important to note that the chain identifier is case-sensitive, and it must be unique within the PDB file for each distinct chain.\n",

    "\n",
    "The B-factor (aka the temperature factor or Debye-Waller factor) is a parameter that represents the thermal vibrations or disorder of atoms in a crystal structure. It is used to describe the uncertainty in the precise position of each atom due to thermal motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The B-factor is a real number associated with each atom or group of atoms in the PDB file. It quantifies how much an atom fluctuates or vibrates around its average position in the crystal lattice. A higher B-factor indicates greater thermal motion or disorder, while a lower B-factor indicates less thermal motion and greater positional certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "This value can be used to gain insights into the flexibility of a molecule or a particular region within a crystal structure. For example, in a protein crystallography study, regions of a protein that are more flexible or less well-ordered may have higher B-factors, whereas well-ordered regions with less thermal motion will have lower B-factors."
