# Quick Start Guide
 
Welcome to the world of computational chemistry! If this is your first time experience the wonders of programming, then I hope this guide helps you. 

The Quick Start Guide is designed for those who:

* Are interested in learning about computational research
* Contemplate pursuring a Ph.D. in this field

But may have doubts about pursuing this path due to limited or no experience in the area. Just know, that it's completely normal to find the terminology and steep learning curve intimidating. Just five years ago, I wasn't even aware that computational science was a thing!

With that in mind, I prepared this collection with these goals in mind:

  1. Brief introduction to the command line interface (CLI)
     - The CLI is (*usually*) the first step for any "computational experiment"
  2. Quickly show you the basics of CLI (with examples)
  3. Information of our supercomputer and usage
     - This is our most important lab equipment!
  4. Basics of python programming, and how to manage your own copy!
  5. Short background on structures files for proteins and small-molecules
  6. Simple introduction to molecular dynamics simulations
     - Includes a simple tutorial which you can run on your computer
