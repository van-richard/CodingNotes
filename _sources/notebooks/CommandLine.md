# Terminal & Command Line

## Overview

Using the terminal will be different depending on whether you're operating system is MacOS or Windows.

Please skip to the section for you.

## MacOS Terminal

You computer should already have the "terminal" application preinstalled. There are 2 way to open the application:

1. Press `cmd`+`[space]`. Then type `terminal`.
2. Click the `launchpad` application. Search for `terminal`.

Congratualations! You opened the terminal!

## Windows Terminal

To use a Linux terminal on a Windows machine, you will need to install the Ubuntu application. This will differ if you're using Windows 10 or Windows 11.

I will write this up, but here is my reference.
