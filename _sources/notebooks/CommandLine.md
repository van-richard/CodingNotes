# Terminal & Command Line

Using the terminal will be different depending on whether you're operating system is MacOS or Windows. I personally use MacOS, so most of my examples may look different.

To start using the terminal, follow these instructions for your operating system:

````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} MacOS
You computer should already have the "terminal" application preinstalled. There are 2 way to open the application:

1. Press `cmd`+`[space]`. Then type `terminal`.
2. Click the `launchpad` application. Search for `terminal`.

Congratulations! You opened the terminal!
```

```{tab-item} Windows
To use a Linux terminal on a Windows machine, you will need to install the Ubuntu application. This will differ if you're using Windows 10 or Windows 11.

I will write this up, but here is my reference.
