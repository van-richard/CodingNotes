# Programming

- `bash` - shell language (you will spend considerable time here)

- `vi/vim` - text editors that drove us all mad

- `ssh` - command for login/remote access to the cluster

- `module` - command to load softwares/applications on the supercomputer

- `python` (`conda` & `jupyter`) 

- `git` - version control system command to track changes, very useful if you want to purge you computer every so often
