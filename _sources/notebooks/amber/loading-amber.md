# Loading Amber 

- To help minimize confusion (and keep me from inhibiting your workflow), I decided to transition from `source ...file.sh` to `module load program` 

- Stable program compilations are separated from those under development, and allows  packages loaded independently 

- For example, to see softwares available on Pete run

```bash
module av # For more information, run 'man module'
```
