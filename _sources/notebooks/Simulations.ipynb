    "\n",
    "- Explicit a particles (atoms, ions)\n",
    "- Particles interact via relatively simple analytical potential (i.e. *force field*)\n",
    "- Newton’s equations of motion are integrated for all particles simultaneously\n",
    "- Hundreds to millions of particles depending on model\n",
    "- Simulation time could be from 10 ps to 1 μs depending on model (typically ns\n",

    "E_{total} = E_{bonds} + E_{angles} + E_{torsion} + E_{vDW} + E_{Coulomb}\n",

    "The potential functions have preset bonding arrangements, therefore, classical MD on its own cannot be used to model chemical reactions.  \n",

    "Quantum mechanical (QM) methods more accurately describe the behavior of the electrons in atoms and molecules and can model chemistry -- the making and breaking of chemical bond. We do this by solving the Schrodinger equation:\n",
