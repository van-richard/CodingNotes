# QM/MM Simulation of the Claisen Rearrangment Reaction

In this tutorial, we will perform a QM/MM simulation of the claisen rearrangement reaction in Amber.

We will study the reaction under implicit solvent, where all ligand atoms included into the QM region, defined by the PM3 semi-empirical method. Umbrella Sampling will be used to explore the reaction coordinate and MBAR to obtain the free energy profile.


**Objectives:**

* Set up QM/MM Simulations on the Supercomputer (Oscer/Pete)
* Prepare a new project folder, "claisen", and look at directory structure/organization
* Use IQmol to model ligand
* Generate parameters for the ligand with `antechamber`, `parmchk2`, and `tleap`
* Prepare Umbrella Windows
* Compute the free energy profile with MBAR

````{note}
**This tutorial requires a supercomputing account!**

## Use IQmol to Make an `allyl_vinyl_ether.pdb`

Use IQmol to make a model of allyl vinyl ether, and save the file as `allyl_vinyl_ether.pdb`, remember to:

1. Add hydrogens
2. Minimize energy
3. Save as `.pdb`
4. Delete all lines except for lines starting with `HETATM` 
    - The IQmol PDB has the wrong bonding information.

I saved the filed onto my Desktop. Remember where you saved it! We will copy it later!!!

## Prepare Project Folder on the Cluster

Login to Pete with `ssh`:

```bash
ssh USERNAME@pete.hpc.okstate.edu  # Change `USERNAME` to your username
```

Go to your `/scratch/USERNAME` directory, and make the project folder, "claisen", and in it, make another folder called "pm3". PME is the semiempirical method we will use to define the QM atoms.

```bash
cd /scratch/USERNAME/  # Change `Username` to your username
mkdir -p claisen/pm3   # Make project folder, and method folder
cd claisen/pm3         # Go there
```

*Before moving on, we should talk about file management.*

## Directories: Flow, Structure, & Organization

Strongly recommend for a project folder to be organized like this schematic.

* The `SYSTEM_DIR` could be whatever biological system you're working on (i.e., cas9, cas12a, etc.). In this folder, we most investigate the same system using differnt methods, hence `METHOD1_DIR` and `METHOD2_DIR`.

* The organization within `METHOD1_DIR` and `METHOD2_DIR` are generally the same if we are studying the same reaction mechanism with umbrella sampling. 

* Between the first umbrella window (`00/`) and the last (`NN/`), we can have as many windows needed to sample our chosen reaction coorindate (**Note:** The placeholder `0` before the `0` and `1`.).

* In each umbrella window, we have an independent simulation.

To structure the directory like this, we will write a `bash` script, and make an `input/` directory containing our reference files.
hematic of Directory Levels:

STEM_DIR/                        # Biological system or project name         
─ METHOD1_DIR/                   # Like METHOD2_DIR but use QM method 1 (or other mutant+METHOD)
─ METHOD2_DIR/                   # Like NETHOD1_DIR but use QM method 2 (or other mutant+METHOD)
  ├── 00/                        # First umbrella window
  ├── 01/                        # Second umbrella window
  ├── ...                        # .....
  ├── NN/                        # Up to however many windows needed 
  │    ├── Trajectories Files    # Each window is an independent simulation
  ├── input/                     # Contains input files:
  │    ├── PDB/in file           #     .mdin, .parm7, .rst7, etc.
  ├── mbar/                # contains scripts for free energy analysis
  │    └── *.py, *.ipynb         # Python and Jupyter notebooks
  ├── gen_inputs.in              # Script for making umbrella windows 
─ └── runmd.slurm                # Slurm scripts
Adopted from Dr. Xiaoliang Pan (hehe)

```{note}

- `mbar/` is the directory for our analysis at the end.
- `gen_inputs.in` is the script we will make!
- `runmd.slurm` is the Slurm script to submit all the jobs
```

## Reference Files to `input/` Directory 

Make the `input` directory. This is where we will store the PDB files and generate Amber inputs. Go into the folder, and use `pwd` to print the current working directory. We will copthe the output from `pwd` for our `scp` command later.

```bash
mkdir input # Make folder
cd input    # Go into folder
pwd         # Print working directory (Copy this output for scp)
```

Copy the PDB file of allyl vinyl ether you made (locally with IQmol) into the `input` folder using `scp`. This will look different depending where you saved files, but open terminal on your local computer and use `scp` to upload the file to this directory (copied from `pwd`):

```bash
scp /path/to/allyl_vinyl_ether.pdb USERNAME@pete.hpc.okstate.edu:---PASTE_THE_PWD_HERE---
```

Before moving on, check if the file transferred correctly. In the Pete terminal window, check if the PDB file is in the `input/` folder.

### Generate Parameters for Allyl Vinyl Ether

Since this is a simulation of a small molecule, we do not have Amber force field parameters for it.

To make a Amber topology and coordinate file for a small molecule, we need to:

1. Add hydrogens (*We did this with IQmol*)
2. Compute charges with `antechamber`
3. Write parameters with `parmchk2`
4. Make topology and coordinate files with `tleap`

I prepared the script, `generate.slurm`, to help with this (**ONLY IF YOU'RE ON PETE**).

The first few lines are the Slurm directives (`#SBATCH`) indicating what resources we need. A brief explanation of each line is given after the `#`.

```shell
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p express
#SBATCH -t 00:10:00
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --output=%j.out
#SBATCH --error=%j.err
#SBATCH --job-name=antechamber

date                                  

# Load Amber QMMM. I made a file that ~looks~ cleaner 
source /scratch/van/Scripts/pete_setqmmm.sh

# Variable "name" is allyl_vinyl_ether, which is a pain to write, so we should only do it once
name="allyl_vinyl_ether"

# Antechamebr is a program with AmberTools for generating FF parameters.
# parmck2 program figures out what parameters and checks if they're available. 
#        If not, it tries to make educated guesses, and adds it to .frmod here
antechamber -fi pdb -fo mol2 -i ${name}.pdb -o ${name}.mol2 -c bcc -pf y -nc 0
parmchk2 -i ${name}.mol2 -f mol2 -o ${name}.frcmod

# The "cat <<_EOF > tleap" makes the files tleap containing everything until "_EOF"
cat <<_EOF > tleap.in
source leaprc.gaff
source leaprc.water.tip3p 

loadamberparams ${name}.frcmod 

ligand = loadmol2 allyl_vinyl_ether.mol2

solvatebox ligand TIP3PBOX 10.0 iso 0.8

saveamberparm ligand step3_pbcsetup.parm7 step3_pbcsetup.rst7
savepdb ligand step3_pbcsetup.pdb

quit
_EOF

# Run tleap in
tleap -sf tleap.in

date
```

Copy of this script to the `inputs/` folder and submit the job to Slurm, it should take about >1 minute.

```bash
sbatch generate.slurm
```

When you `ls` the directory you should see a few new files:

---

### Restraint Files `cv.rst`

A restraint file (`cv.rst`) contains information about the parameters for each umbrella window.

The Amber protein has a lot of different restraints you can try, but for this reaction, we want to keep the bias on the bond breaking and bonding forming.

We need to find the __Amber atom numbers__ involved in the reaction. Load `step3_pbcsetup.pdb` into IQmol or VMD.

```{figure} ../../_static/images/iqmol_claisen_num.png
---
width: 50%
align: center
---
Open  the file, step3_pbcsetup.pdb, you made with tleap. This PDB file is made by amber so the atom numbers also correspond to the topology and cooridnate files. 
```

```{tip}
Show atom index: "Display > Atom Labels > Index"
```

The bond between Carbon atoms 3 and 4 are broken, wheres we see a bond forming between the Oxygen atom (atom 1) and a Carbon atom (atom 6).

To model this reaction in the simplest way possible, we would like to make the **reaction coordinate 1-Dimentional!**

*but we have two bond distances change*

A common approch to this is make the reaction coorindinate equal to the difference in distance between the two bonds of interest

$$
\mathrm{r} = \mathrm{r}_{\mathrm{bond break}} - \mathrm{r}_{\mathrm{bond form}}
$$

where,


$\mathrm{r}_{\mathrm{bond break}}$ is $\mathrm{r}_{\mathrm{C - C}}$ which is the bond distancbetween atoms 3 and 4

$\mathrm{r}_{\mathrm{bond form}}$ is $\mathrm{r}_{\mathrm{O - C}} $ which is the bond distance between atoms 1 and 6

We know which atoms to to use for our reaction coordinate now. We will take the bond breaking distance - the bond forming distance giving us a distance of about 2 Angstrom.

### Notation of `cv.rst`

Using all of that information, we can make the refernce file for `cv.rst`. The file looks like this:

```shell
# r1 - r2 (CC - CO bond)
 &rst
  iat=3,4,1,6,
  rstwt=1.,-1.,
  r1=-99, r2=__REST__, r3=__REST__, r4=99,
  rk2=150.0, rk3=150.0,
 &end
```

Each parameter is described by:

- `# r1 - r2 (CC - CO bond)` Just a comment for us to remember what that restraint is! In this case, we are doing restraining the difference between the first distance (r1) and the second distance (r2). 

- `iat=3,4,1,6,` Atom numbers for the restraint. The first distance (r1) is the length between atoms 3 and 4. The second distance (r2) is the length between atoms 1 and 6.

- `rstwt=1.,-1.,` Indicates we want to take the difference between r1 and r2 (r1  -r2)

- `r1=-99, r2=__REST__, r3=__REST__, r4=99,` The shape of our biasing potential. `__REST__` is a placeholder which we will modify later.

- `rk2=150.0, rk3=150.0,` Force constant in kcal/mol.

Copy `cv.rst` file and save it in the `input` folder.

```{important}

You **do not** need to modify!! We will use `geninput.in` to do it for us!

Generating this file is very important! If you get the indexes wrong, you might run into some simulation problems!
```

### QM/MM MD Input files

We need at leat 2 MD input files. The first file (`step5.00_equilibration.mdin`) is for simulating the initial pathway, and only runs for a few picoseconds. The second file (`step6.00_equilibration.mdin`) is will restart from the previous `step5.00_equilibration.ncrst` for additional 10 ps.

The general format of a QM/MM MD input file differs from classical MD with the `&qmmm` section.

## Automate the Umbrella Windows

Go back one directory to the `pm3/` folder

```bash
cd ../ # Return back one directory
pwd    # Check where y
```

The script `gen_inputs.in` will help you prepare windows for umbrella sampling. This includes the modification in  `cv.rst` file so that each window has a different restraint value.

We will have 21 windows corresponding to restraint values -2.00 to 2.00 Å.

::::{tab-set}

do
    nn=$(printf "%.2f" "$n")
    sed "s/__REST__/${nn}/g" input/cv.rst > ${i}/cv.rst
    n=`echo $n + 0.20 | bc`
done

```

sed -e 's/irest=1/irest=0/;s/ntx=5/ntx=1,/' ../input/step5.00_equilibration.mdin > step5.00_equilibration.mdin
cd ..

```

First, we make the window `00/`. I did this outside of section 2, so it is easier to read than adding an `if...else` statement. 
Essentially, since we just made our `.parm7` and `.rst7` file from tleap, our initial structure does not contain any velocities. So we need to change the options "irest" and "ntx"

`ln -sf` make a symbolic link pointing to the original file! Do this becuause you do not want too many copies of the same file..

`sed` does the test transformation for our initial `.mdin` file. 

:::
:::{tab-item} Section 2 - WEET
```shell

# Section 2
for i in `seq -w 1 20`; do
mkdir -p $i
cd $i
ln -sf ../input/step3_pbcsetup.parm7
ln -sf ../input/step5.00_equilibration.mdin .
ln -sf ../input/step6.00_equilibration .
cd ..
done

```

`seq -w 1 20` - is just a sequence of number from 1 to 20. The `-w` flag  pads the number with a `0` so all numbers are equal width.

In `bash` when you wrap a command in backtick (`), you can use the standard output of this command as the input, so this line is saying: 

for every NUMBER in NUMBERS (NUMBERS = list from 00, 01,02,03.... all the way to 20); do **THIS** 

**THIS** meaning:

1. Make a directory for "NUMBER"
2. Go into the directory, - > "NUMBER"
3. Make a symbolic link to these files.....
4. leave directory,
5. done, GO BACK TO BEGINNING OF LOOP AND GET NEXT NUMBER. THEN REPEAT CYCLE UNTIL LIST IS DONE

:::
:::{tab-item} Section 3 - YEET
```shell

# Section 3
cp ../input/step3_pbcsetup.rst7 00/step5.00_equilibration_inp.rst7

n=-2.0
for i in `seq -f"%02g" 0 20`
do
    nn=$(printf "%.2f" "$n")
    sed "s/__REST__/${nn}/g" input/cv.rst > ${i}/cv.rst
    n=`echo $n + 0.20 | bc`
done


```

`cp` takes the coordinate file we made, `step3_pbcsetup.rst7`, and make a copy of to window `00/` AND names the file, `step5.00_equilibration_inp.rst7`. **Note this file has `_inp.rst7`**

The last part of section 3 is a loop incrementing the restraint file for each window!

`n=-2.0` is for our first restraint value (i.e. window `00/`)

The beginning of this `for` loop is similar to section 2, where were are looping over a list of numbers between 0 and 20. 

`seq -f"%02g" 0 20` looks different here but it does the same thing as the `-w` option. I just wanted to show you other approachs.

`do` is on a new line, but recall that the `;` also means new line!

`nn=$(printf "%.2f" "$n")` says nn is the value of `n` to two decimal places.

In `bash` when you want to use the standard output as a variable you can wrap the command in backticks (\`) or us the "`$(....)`" notation. They both do the same thing. *we saw the backticks ealier for the `seq` command. The command that is being wrapped is just `printf`, or print format, where the format of `$n` is a **f**loating point type, and the “.2” says only show the first 2 digits after the point. Example: `n=-2.0` then `printf` make `nn=-2.00`. Then you use `sed` to transform `__REST__` to `nn=-2.00` and output `>` this file to `${i}` which is the __UMBRELLA WINDOW__. Finally, last line of the loop will add `n=-2.00` + `0.20`, changing the value of `n` to `n=-1.80` for window `01/`.

:::
::::

I hope that wasn't too bad, you can run the script by typing:

```bash
bash gen_inputs.in
```

```{tip}

The reason why we renamed the file `step3_pbcsetup.rst7` as `step5.00_equilibration_inp.rst7` is because this will make our Slurm script easier. If you noticed, now all of our files start with `step5.00_equilibration`...

## Running the QM/MM Simulations

We have 2 files to make.

1. `runqmmm1.slurm` - for `step5.00_equilibration.mdin`
2. `runqmmm2.slurm` - for `step6.00_equilibration.mdin`

Submit `runqmmm1.slurm` to Slurm.

`for i in `seq 0 20`; do` - We're looping over number of windows!

`printf -v j "%02d" $i` - pads the number (add a 0 in front) and the `-v` flag makes this a new variable `$j`

`cd $j` Go into the directory `$j` ( which is the same as "`0${i}/`" if i is a single-digit number)

`printf -v j "%02d" $(($i + 1))` has 2 things happening:

- **STEP 2.** `printf -v j "%02d" `**STEP 1.** is print formt to a padded zero *if single digit* and make this variable "`$j`"

A lot more simple that `runqmmm1.slurm`. Normally, I **DO NOT** use a loop to cover every window. I would use Slurm arrays and have each window be submitted as its own job. But since this is a really small system. it will finish in the express node.

```{important}

`step5.00_equilibration.mdin`

The first step where we need generate the intial pathway will take a lot of time.....

## Free Energy Profile with MBAR

```{warning}

I do not know if this works on Windows, so try this on pete first!

To do this part, you need to:

* Install the `mbar` environment to Conda on Pete ([Tutorial](../python/myenv)). Copy the two scripts in mentioned here to a `Scripts/` folder.

For this analysis, I copy the `mbar.ipynb` to the project's `mbar/` folder

The `mbar.ipynb` noteboook looks like this, in the refernce file, you can see a pdf file containing th the output from my analysis

```python
import sys
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.ticker import AutoMinorLocator, LogLocator, NullFormatter
from glob import glob
from sklearn.utils import resample

import pymbar
sys.path.append("/Users/van/Scripts/")
from mbar_pmf import mbar_pmf

n_windows = 21 
val_kn = []
for i in range(n_windows):
    fnames = sorted(glob('../%02d/step6.0?_equilibration.cv' % i))
    arrays = [np.loadtxt(f, usecols=1)[::] for f in fnames[:]]
    val_kn.append(np.concatenate(arrays))
val0_k = np.linspace(-2.00, 2.00, n_windows)
K_k = np.ones(n_windows) * 300.0
val_min = -2.00
val_max = 2.00
nbins = n_windows - 1

for i in range(n_windows):
    print("Window %02d:" % i, pymbar.timeseries.subsampleCorrelatedData(val_kn[i], conservative=True))

mbar = mbar_pmf(val_kn, val0_k, K_k, 300.0)

bin_centers, f_i, df_i, reweighting_entropy = mbar.get_pmf(val_min, val_max, nbins)
bin_centers, f_i, df_i, reweighting_entropy = mbar.get_pmf(val_min, val_max, nbins, uncertainties='from-specified', pmf_reference=f_i[:20].argmin())
np.savetxt("freefile_mbar", np.column_stack((bin_centers, f_i, df_i)))

initial = np.loadtxt('freefile_mbar' )

bar=float(np.round(initial[:,1].max() - initial[:10,1].min(),1))
err=float(np.round(initial[initial[:,1].argmax()][2],1))

plt.errorbar(initial[:,0], initial[:,1] - initial[:10,1].min(), yerr=initial[:,2], linewidth=2, label="PM3")
plt.text(-0.4, 0,'$\Delta$G$^\ddag$ = %s $\pm$ %s kcal mol$^{-1}$' % (bar, err), fontsize=14)

plt.xlabel("R1 - R2 (Å)", fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel("Potential of Mean Force (kcal/mol)", fontsize=12)
plt.legend(loc=2, fontsize=11)

plt.savefig("claisen_pmf.png", dpi=300)
plt.show()
