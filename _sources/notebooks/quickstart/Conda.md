# Conda

Some open-source programs are written in python and then hosted on GitHub, which is great!.... Until you find it's written in a different version of python...

I had multiple version of python on laptop until I was shown **Conda**!

The perks of using Conda to manage python is the ability to create *virtual environments* in your computer.

With :term:`conda` commands, you can create an environment (i.e. a small storage space in your laptop) to install some specific versions of packages. **And this will not interfere or conflict with anything else on your computer!**

I mainly use :term:`miniforge` on laptop and supercomputer accounts, but be sure to explore what works best for you!
