# A (not so) Quick Start Guide

*I intended for this to be read within 30 minutes... Sorry! (December 9, 2023)*

:class: sidebar
**Info, Example, and Task** This guide is intended to provide enough information to get yourself set up no lab. Honestly, it is quite bare. Once you feel comfortable, try the other sections! If you're confused, don't hesitate to send me questions! 
:::

To those with no background in programming, there is a lot to take in. So don't rush, look at other examples, and ask lots of questions! 

**Objective** Getting comfortable with:

  1. Terminal and Command Line
  2. Supercomputing and SLURM
  3. Python and Conda
  4. Structure Files (`.pdb`/`.xyz`)
  5. Molecular Dynamics with Amber
