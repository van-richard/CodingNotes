# What are XYZ Files?

The XYZ file format is a text-file format. Unlike PDB files, there is no formal standard and several variations exist. However, a typical XYZ format specifies the molecule geometry by giving the number of atoms with Cartesian coordinates that will be read on the first line, a comment on the second, and the lines of atomic coordinates in the following lines. 

Typically, we use these files to store molecular geometries in Quantum Mechanical (QM) calculations. These files generally contain up to a few hundred atoms. For example, let's build the small molecule alanine dipeptide, and store this data in `.xyz`.

## Example with Alanine Dipeptide

Alanine dipeptide is the amino acid, Alanine, with the N-/C-terminal capped by an N-acetyl and Nâ€²-methylamide to neutralize the charges. First we will build alanine dipeptide via IQmol, then save the structure as `ala.xyz`:

1. Open up the software, IQmol
2. Use your mouse/trackpad and click any area on the screen
3. Starting with the first Carbon atom, add the rest of the atoms, ignoring hydrogen
4. Click on the 'C' to get the periodic table
5. Click on Nitrogen, and replace the appropriate Carbons
6. Repeat step 5. but with Oxygen
7. Click on the `add hydrogens` button
8. Click on the `minimize energy` button
9. Save the structure as `ala.xyz` to your desired location (I saved them to my `~/Desktop/`)

## Open the `ala.xyz` File

First, open your terminal, and then change directories to where you saved the `ala.xyz`. Since I saved them to my `~/Desktop/`, I will `cd` there, and use `less` to view `ala.xyz`:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/
less ala.xyz
```

You should see something like this:

Explanations:

- The first line of `ala.xyz` is the total number of atoms.
- The second line is reserved for comments, so you can include details about the structure here
- The rest of the file contains the elemental symbol, followed by x-,y-z- coodinates

Simple yeah?

> "The primary information stored in the PDB archive consists of coordinate files for biological molecules. These files list the atoms in each protein, and their 3D location in space. These files are available in several formats (PDB, mmCIF, XML). A typical PDB formatted file includes a large "header" section of text that summarizes the protein, citation information, and the details of the structure solution, followed by the sequence and a long list of the atoms and their coordinates. The archive also contains the experimental observations that are used to determine these atomic coordinates."
