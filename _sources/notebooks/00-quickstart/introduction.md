*I intended for this to be read within 30 minutes... Sorry! (December 9, 2023)*

- For those with ZERO experience in computers, this guide offers a basic introduction to several computational tools I used in my time as Ph.D. candidate
  - Become familiar with the language, workflow, and concepts, supporting your baseline understanding of these tools. In the next few pages

**Our Objective.** Is to become familiar with:

  1. Use text commands to navigate your computer
  2. Access the supercomputer and utilize SLURM
  3. Code with Python and use a package manager
  4. Understand molecular structure files (`.pdb`/`.xyz`)
  5. Briefly discuss molecular dynamics simulation concepts

**Other Resources.** In addition, to my notes (which is poorly written), I encourage you to explore other resources.
